            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>YOur Lordſhip's favourable acceptance of this following Sermon, and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be Printed (for ſuch force Your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb facs="tcp:102444:3"/>carries with me) have at length made me adventure to preſent it to Your Lordſhip's View, with hope, that what upon hearing had Your approbation, will upon ſight paſs how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for allowable.</p>
            <p>After Your Lordſhip's declaring in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of it, I am little concern'd what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception 'twill find abroad, believing with ſome reaſon that what ſuch a Judgment diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approves not, can not eaſily diſpleaſe the Good and Candidly Judicious, and 'tis the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſuch only I have value for.

This my Lord it is that makes You Venerable, this gains You the Hearts of all good men, makes You awful to the bad. This will make You a Publick Bleſſing whilſt You live, Embalm Your Memory when dead? Nay, make You live after Death on Earth, in the Hearts and

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He greateſt and moſt important En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry that ever was in the World, was that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Who will ſhew us any Good?</hi> Who will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to us wherein true Bleſſedneſs lies, and by what wayes and means we may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to obtain it? An Enquiry that every man is highly concerned to be ſatisfied in, from that common Principle of Nature that inclines every thing to ſeek its own Preſervation and Wellbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But ſuch Darkneſs had man's Apoſtacy brought upon his mind, that he was utterly at
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102444:5"/>loſs how to arrive at any ſatisfaction in this Search, as by the great variety of differing Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about man's chiefeſt good ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. Sad and deplorable was the condition of the World, plung'd in miſery, and loſt as to all Remedy within Nature's ken and reach, when our bleſſed Saviour, the true light of the World, came from Heaven, on purpoſe to diſcover that happineſs that mankind was groping after in the dark, and to this end communicated his light to thoſe that were his firſt Hearers, not only to guide their own feet in the paths of peace, but that they by the light of their Doctrine, and good example, might illuminate a dark World, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe the beams of ſaving truth from one end of the Heavens to the other, and by propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to their Succeſſors, make ſuch a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble day to thoſe Nations that had long ſate in darkneſs, and the ſhaddow of death, as ſhould know no night to the worlds end: And to this purpoſe he enjoyns them here in the Text; <hi>Let your Light ſo ſhine, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words, whether they were ſpoken to the promiſcuous multitude of the Diſciples, or appropriated to thoſe that were to be the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and Diſpenſers of the Goſpel Myſtery, is diſputed amongſt Interpreters, nor need it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by me. 'Tis ſufficient for my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, that though the Charge here given
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102444:5"/>belong not ſolely to the Apoſtles and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, yet it caſts a peculiar aſpect upon them, it takes faſter hold of them by an acceſſion of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ties, and binds them to its obedience in a higher and more improved ſence: And that's ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to warrant my addreſſing a Diſcourſe to my Brethren of the Clergy from theſe words: In which as they have a peculiar regard to them, they contain a duty enjoyn'd, with a reaſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing it; and in the duty enjoyned theſe three things. 1. A knowledge of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and that ſuch a knowledge as may enable us to inſtruct others. 2. A vigorous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to propagate our light, and to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this wholeſome knowledge to others. 3. A life conformable to this Doctrine. Of theſe in their order, beginning with the firſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A knowledge of the Goſpel Myſteries, and that ſuch a knowledge as may enable us to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct others in them. The great end why the Goſpel Miniſtry was ſet up, was <hi>to turn ſinners from darkneſs to light, from the power of Satan to God,</hi> and the chains wherewith the Devil holds men in captivity are chains of darkneſs. <hi>They are altenated from the life of God through the darkneſs that is in them.</hi> All the affairs of this dark Kingdom are carried on by Falſhood and Impoſture. All the Sophiſticate Wares that he obtrudes upon men, for which he gains their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102444:6"/>ſouls in exchange, are put off by the advantage of darkneſs and obſcurity; hence ſinners and fools are terms convertible in Scripture, and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that all ſins in ſome ſence are ſins of Ignorance is good Divinity. The Devil deals with ſinners as <hi>Eliſha</hi> with the <hi>Syrians,</hi> firſt ſmites them with blindneſs, and then leads them captive at his pleaſure; as the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> firſt bores their eyes out, and then they are fit for his drudgery. Twould ſpoil the Merchants of Hell to have their Merchandiſe ſeen by a true light: And conſequently he that would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to reſcue ſinners from under the Prince of darkneſs, muſt be furniſhed with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knowledge, with a clear and bright under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, able to repreſent things in their true co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; the beauty of holineſs and the deformity of fin, both ſtript of thoſe diſguiſes the Devil puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to make the one lovely, and the other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. A little knowledge with an honeſt heart may qualifie an ordinary Chriſtian for Heaven: But 'tis no ſmall ſcantling of knowledge will qualifie a man to undertake <hi>ex officio,</hi> the charge of conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others thither: 'Tis ſufficient for an ordinary Chriſtian to know his own duty, his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, his own temptations; but he that hath the care of others ſouls, muſt know what duty belongs to them in their different Stations; What temptations their various conditions are aſſaulted

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102444:7"/>not in ſome meaſure hold the reigns of their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in his hands. So difficult and important is the Miniſterial Charge, that the Father had reaſon to ſay 'twas a work <hi>Angelorum humeris formidandum,</hi> and not to be managed by every trifling undertaker. So ſenſible was the great Apoſtle of the weightineſs of it, though endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with extraordinary abilities from Heaven, that he cries out, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things!</hi> How much then doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us, upon whom theſe miniſterial abilities are not conferred but by God's bleſſing upon our own induſtry implored by earneſt prayer, to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, pray, read, meditate, that we may be enabled to diſcharge our Function; ſo, that we may not be aſhamed of our workmanſhip, that God and our conſciences may approve of us, that others may receive benefit, and we find favour and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the day of righteous retributions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing included in this Charge, as it caſts a peculiar aſpect upon the Miniſters of the Goſpel, is a vigorous endeavour to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate our light, and to impart this ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to others, which is done by inſtructing their Ignorance, and awakening their conſideration. Firſt, by inſtructing their Ignorance, addreſſing to their Underſtandings, illightning the minds of men to make a right judgment of things. The Underſtanding, which is the leading faculty
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102444:8"/>of the ſoul muſt firſt be enlightned, before the will which is the principle of action can embrace what's good and avoid what's evil. What ever the grace of God does in renewing the minds of men, it does it by firſt irradiating the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; And the Miniſters of the Goſpel, who are ſubworkers to Grace, muſt proceed in the ſame method. Light was the firſt in the Old Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the rude maſs of being began to put on Beauty, and 'tis the firſt in the new Creation, when Chriſt is formed in the ſoul. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be his firſt work, and buſineſs to bring them to a right underſtanding, to reſtore them to their right minds. But he muſt not think it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to convey truth into their underſtandings and leave it there, but he muſt work it upon their affections by awakening their conſideration, by all the forcible motives of perſwaſion, by all the arts of wiſe and prudent inſinuation, forcing all the paſſions and affections within men to engage on the ſide of truth, to print it the deeper in their minds. Sometimes awakening their fears by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the terrours of the Lord, ſometimes animating their Hopes, by ſhewing them the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the Righteous. He muſt never give them over till the truth is rooted in their ſouls, and till the fruits of piety appear in their lives. No nor then neither, but ſtill he muſt be watering the tender plants, ſtill cheriſhing all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102444:8"/>good beginnings, the firſt ſproutings of piety, and encouraging ſmall proficients to greater growth, the good proficients to aſpire after perfection, till Grace ripen into Glory, and all the Runners in this Race, all the Combatants in this Warefare have got the Crowns on their Heads, and the Palms of Victory in their Hands. Never forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the while to beg of God, who alone gives the encreaſe to <hi>Paul</hi>'s planting and <hi>Apollo</hi>'s wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, to crown his endeavours with ſucceſs. And to excite himſelf hereto ſuch conſiderations will be uſeful.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this is the end for which all Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al abilities were beſtowed, <hi>Ephſ.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers; For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> All theſe ſeveral Orders of Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, and all variety of gifts that qualifie for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their ſeveral Functions, were for the benefit of the Church of God. And no Talents ſhall be more ſeverely accounted for than thoſe given for this uſe. The very beſtowing them is an exaction of duty, the receiving them like that of Preſs-money, an engagement to ſervice and employment. If we let theſe Treaſures lie by and ruſt, the very ruſt of them will witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:102444:9"/>2. 'Tis the beſt teſtimony of our love, the greateſt proof of our fidelity to our Lord and Maſter. That great lover of Souls hath intruſted many of them to our care, and in them the worth of many Worlds is depoſited in our hands. Whether they ſhall live Eternal Ages in Joyes, too big for Mortal thoughts to conceive, or die the Devil's Slaves, and partake his torments, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends in great meaſure upon our care in inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting them. What value our Saviour puts upon them is beſt underſtood by the price he paid for them, they were redeemed with the blood of God; and by his paſſionate recommending them to the care of thoſe whom he appointed their Guides and Inſtructors. <hi>Simon Son of Jonah loveſt thou me? Feed my Sheep.</hi> And again, and a third time, <hi>loveſt thou me? Feed my Sheep, feed my Lambs.</hi> If we have any affection for that Saviour of ours to whom we owe our preſent valuable enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all our future hopes; if any compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for thoſe ſouls which are the purchaſe of his blood, if any regard of that important truſt that muſt be accounted for with greateſt ſeverity, we cannot but bend all the Forces and Powers of our Souls to the diſcharge of it, and apply our ſelves to it with greateſt chearfulneſs and alacrity in teſtimony of the great honour he hath put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: For</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is the Nobleſt employment in the World.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102444:9"/>A work of the greateſt Charity, and Charity is the work of Heaven. The greateſt object of compaſſion in the World are the ſouls of men blinded by Ignorance, enſlaved to luſt, in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to the Devil; and the greateſt labour of Love is that that's undergone to reſcue them out of that captivity. To cloath naked backs, and feed empty bowels, and redeem miſerable Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives from the thraldom of mercileſs Tyrants, is a charity that God accepts, and highly rewards. But to cloath the nakedneſs of mens underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by making them wiſe to ſalvation, to feed poor hunger-ſtarved ſouls with the bread of life, to break off the Devil's fetters, and redeem them from helliſh tyranny, is a charity as much more noble, as Eternity exceeds Time, as the Souls of men are of more worth than their Bodies. 'Tis a Work that rejoyces Heaven, cauſes Joy amongſt the Angels. Thoſe Bleſſed Spirits keep, (as it were) a Feſtival upon the day of a ſinner's New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth. And ſhall a work applauded by all the Inhabitants of Heaven be managed with coldneſs and indifferency, with faint and languiſhing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. There's nothing makes men more Godlike than becoming great and publick Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors; and none are more Eminently ſo, than they that are inſtrumental to turn many ſouls to Righteouſneſs. He that hath any ſenſe of true Godlineſs in his heart, cannot but think it one
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102444:10"/>of the greateſt bleſſings God can beſtow upon him, to make him an inſtrument of deriving bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings upon a Multitude: Much more, bleſſings of that importance that do men good for ever, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that fit and prepare men for Heaven, that ſhall be everlaſtingly remembred there with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Hallelujahs to God the Author, and eternal acknowledgments to men the inſtruments. For it is not to be ſuppoſed Ingratitude, a Vice ſo dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible on Earth, ſhould ever find any place in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This will be a very great evidence of our own ſin cericy. 'Tis the nature, the true <hi>Indoles</hi> of true Piety, where-ever it is, to ſpread and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it ſelf. All good is communicative, and the better any thing is, the more diffuſive. Piety en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges the hearts of men to eſpouſe the Intereſt of all mankind; 'tis a dayly prompter to good and worthy actions, whereby others may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged; an active, reſtleſs Principle that can no more ceaſe from benefitting all that come within its reach, than fire can ceaſe from burning, or a ſpring from ſtreaming forth. The love of God and man are the Elements of its Nature. Above all, it makes men painful and induſtrious in their Callings, faithful in their own places and ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Since then God hath made it our buſineſs and employment in the World to communicate the knowledge of himſelf and his Chriſt to men,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102444:10"/>to direct them in the Paths that lead to eternal happineſs; We cannot have a better evidence that we are partakers of the Divine Nature, than by imitating the Divine Goodneſs in employing thoſe Talents he hath beſtowed upon us, to the uſe for which he deſigned them. Our own Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will be beſt made out by our reſemblance to our Heavenly Father, and Almighty goodneſs is that Character that moſt readily offers it ſelf to the minds of men, when they would ſrame an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> of God within themſelves.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The faithful performance of this duty is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed with an ample &amp; Superlative reward, Every Soul that we are inſtrumental to bring to Heaven will add a new luſtre to our Crown, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. <hi>They that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament, and they that turn many to righteouſneſs as the Start for ever and ever,</hi> or if that place be capable of another meaning that of our Saviour will put it out of doubt, <hi>He that receives a Prophet in the name of a Prophet ſhall receive a Prophet's neward.</hi> Where if <hi>a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's reward</hi> did not in port ſomething extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and tranſcendent, there would be nothing of encouragement and enforcement to the duty. And if we had not this aſſurance of a Divine Promiſe, it might be ſtrongly argued from that natural influence the happineſs we are inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to procure for other, will have upon our own.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102444:11"/>To be inſtrumental to bring Souls to Heaven, to add new Members to the Church Triumphant, is to provide ſo many everlaſting Monuments of our pious care and pains, whoſe Joys will all unite and center upon us, we looking upon them but as our ſelves divided, <hi>Children begotten by us to God, with whom we travel'd in pain, till Chriſt was formed in them.</hi> Beſides, God who in juſtice pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the Acceſſory, as well as the Principal in evil deeds, will be more inclinable to reward in us that good, that others do by our counſel, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion and direction, by how much he is more prone to ſhew mercy, in which he delights, than to afflict the children of men, which he does un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly. And what an encouragement is this to labour in the Lord's Harveſt, to ſpend our ſelves for the good of our Flocks, when every ſoul that we are inſtrumental to ſave from death, will bring ſuch an accumulation to our Joyes, and add a new Coronet to our Crown.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third thing in this Charge, is a Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Doctrine of the Goſpel. Not to mention the obligations common to us with the reſt of Chriſtians, there are ſeveral conſiderations peculiar to us as Miniſters of the Goſpel, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the ſtricteſt conformity to the Laws thereof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whereas other men, by the urgency and exigence of their ſecular employments, have their thoughts often called off from attending the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102444:11"/>Concerns of Eternity; Our very office and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in this World confines our thoughts to the things of another. It is the happy Priviledge of men of our Order that their general calling as Chriſtians, and more ſpecial as Miniſters, do in a manner <hi>coincidere,</hi> fall into one, at leaſt they hold an intimate correſpondence, and lend a friendly aſſiſtance to each other. Thoſe larger portions of time that others are generally obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon employments ſecular, we are engaged to ſpend in ſuch, as promore our own and others ſalvation. And if the want of conſideration oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion moſt mens neglect of the Goſpel (as 'tis certain it does.) It is but juſt and reaſonable to expect that they whoſe office obliges them to give themſelves wholly to the meditation and practice of divine things, who are <hi>Juris Evangelici con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulti,</hi> ſhould live moſt exactly anſwerable to the Goſpel Law. <hi>Abeunt ſtudia in Mores,</hi> ſaid the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, mens ſtudies have an influence upon their morals. Both God and men then will expect that they whoſe ſole employment it is to regulate their own and others Lives according to the admirable Rules of Chriſtian Religion ſhould walk ſuteably to their profeſſion. Eſpecially being provided for in temporals almoſt without their care, that they may with leſs diſtraction attend the affairs of a higher nature. They ſhould endeavour to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape not only <hi>Vitia,</hi> but <hi>infirma Naturae,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102444:12"/>frailties incident to humanity, and approach as near as poſſible to perfection of Angels, whom they ſo nearly reſemble in employment, <hi>they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ministring ſpirits ſent forth for the good of thoſe who ſhall be heirs of Salvation.</hi> What great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er indecency can there be, than for men that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe frequently with holy things, and toſs them often in their thoughts to have no ſenſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of them upon their hearts? To meditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the love of God and Chriſt, to be able to tell affectionate and melting ſtories of it to others, and that poſſibly with a ſeeming tranſport of affection, and yet to freez by this fire; to have the paſſage betwixt the head &amp; heart ſo obſtructed, that not a ſpark of truth that enlightens the underſtanding can get into the heart, and warm it with ſuch a love as is the ſpring of obedience, is ſuch a Devil's Miracle as vies with that of Almighty God, who preſerved the three Children from all ſmell of fire in the midſt of a fiery Furnace. That men, who can diſcover to others the Reaſonableneſs, the Neceſſity, the Beauty of Religion, ſhould neither be prevailed upon by the Reaſon, nor conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Neceſſity, nor charmed with the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it, is the moſt unaccountable thing in the World. What will they be able to anſwer to God, to their own Conſciences, when their own Reaſonings, Diſcourſes, Sermons will riſe up in Judgment againſt them? What will they do in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102444:12"/>the day of Viſitation, when the great Biſhop of their Souls will call them to account for their ſcandalous and unchriſtian Lives, ſo diſſonant to the Principles of that holy Doctrine they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be the Teachers of?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The great influence of our Examples <hi>in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>

A little to change my Author's words, <hi>Eo ſumus loco conſtituti, ut bona malaque noſtra ad Rempub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licam pertineant.</hi> We can neither go to Heaven, nor Hell ſolitary. I mean, we cannot go to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe ſo diſtant places, but in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity others will attend as drawn by the Influence of our Examples.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Our Holy and Exemplary Lives will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Labours more ſuccesful, add Authority and Veneration to our Perſons, weight to our words, make them <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oracles,</hi> the Seed of a New Birth. Not but that the Seed may proſper what ever the hand be that ſows it. 'Tis God's bleſſing gives the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and that depends not on the qualification of the Inſtrument: But yet 'tis moſt uſually found attending upon the endeavours of good men.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102444:13"/>Our Saviour himſelf (I think I may ſay) would not have been thought to have ſpoke as never man ſpake, if he had not lived as never man liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. With what irreſiſtible Authority did he check the ſins of others, when he uſhered in his reproofs of them with his appeal to themſelves touching his own innocency? <hi>Which of you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces me of ſin?</hi> Chriſtian Religion is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Divinity of its Author, in the Purity of its Precepts, in the excellency of its end, in the mightineſs of its aids; but its Beauty is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen to advantage till it become viſible in mens lives. Then it moſt charms the affections of men, recommends it ſelf to their eſteem and approbation, when it ſubdues Luſt and governs Paſſions, and adorns the Converſation. When it makes men meek and merciful, pure and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, humble and reſigned, watchful to lay hold of, and improve all opportunities to do good. When to a great meaſure of knowledge theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications unite in the ſame Perſon, his Doctrine diſtils as the rain, winds it ſelf into the hearts of men, inſinuates into their affections, takes faſt hold of their ſouls. Beſides the bleſſing that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends upon a good man that renders his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſucceſsful, there is a natural aptneſs in his words to work an Impreſſion on his Hearers. His own ſoul having the ſtamp of truth upon it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt into the mold of it, and touch'd with a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102444:13"/>ſenſe of its importance, and a tender love and compaſſion to the Souls of men, will oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to preſs it home with that unaffected gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſeriouſneſs, that his very heart will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſelf in his Language, he will give you a raſte of his ſoul in his Diſcourſe. His words come from the heart, and are moſt likely to reach the hearts of others, they proceed from a living Principle, and are moſt likely to beget life in his Hearers. Even <hi>Seneca</hi> would adviſe his Friend <hi>Lucilius</hi> to make uſe of ſuch Inſtructors. <hi>Qui vità. docent, qui cum dixerint quid faciendum ſit, faciendo, probant; qui docent quid vitandum ſit, nee unquam in eo quod fugiendum dixerint depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henduntur; quos magìs admireris, cum videris, quam cum audieris.</hi> A good Life with him was beyond all Topicks of Perſwaſions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Our ill Examples have a malignant influence, and ſcatter infection far and wide, will give Authority to Vice, and furniſh it with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe and apology. If the Salt of the earth loſe its ſavour, rotteuneſs and putrefaction will cover the face of it. Two things make wickedneſs bold and daring, and overflow beyond all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, when 'tis either eſtabliſhed by a Law, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by leading examples. 'Tis obſervable all along that the greateſt ſymptoms of decaying piety were legible in the vitious lives of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Clergy. And th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In all probability he will wink at thoſe vices in others which he allows in himſelf, ſpare to ſtrike at the root of thoſe ſins where every blow he gives lights upon himſelf. For with what face can he control the vices of others, whoſe reproofs rebound upon himſelf and flie in his own Face? With what likelihood of ſucceſs can he attempt to ſhame men out of their ſins, who by his own example brings ſin into cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit? Will thoſe Remedies he tenders to others be accepted and eſteemed by them, when 'tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent he either never uſed them, or if he did found them ineffectual?

To what end ſerves the Miniſtry but to perſwade people to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Hearts and Lives to the laws and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the holy Jeſus? And what more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual courſe can we take to render all our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours inſuccesful, than to ſhame our own profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by an unſutable Converſation, to violate thoſe Laws we ſhould enforce obedience to, to confute our holy Doctrine by a lewd practice? Little credit is given to him who frequently contradicts himſelf, and no contradiction ſo injurious to a holy Doctrine as an unholy life. <hi>Quid verbis opus est cum facta videam,</hi> is but too uſual a Plea though very unwarrantable whereby men ſhift off the obligations preſt upon them by thoſe who break looſe from all the ties of duty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Sin reflects contempt upon every thing it meddles with, makes not only the perſons of men deſpiſed, but their uſeful Counſels, their wholeſom Reproofs, their beſt and moſt convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Arguments loſe their value and eſteem, as coming from them.

            <p n="3">3. Conformity of life to the Laws of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is the ready way to obtain that skill in the Myſteries of Chriſtianity that will render us abl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis only by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good and eſchewing evil that we come to have our ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern betwixt the one and the other. There is a ſpiritual ſenſation in the ſoul of man that ſees a Beauty, and reliſhes a ſweetneſs in all the acts enjoyn'd by Religion, that lies aſleep, unleſs by an active and vigourous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of our duty it be exerciſed and ſtirred up.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I add fourthly the conſideration of the Perſon whom we repreſent, the Perſon of the Son of God, the Great High Prieſt of our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, who was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners. A Perſon that never trode one ſtep awry. A Divine pattern of holineſs and purity, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and charity. His whole life was a paraphraſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102444:16"/>of this Sermon upon the Mount: All his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Motions, whole Behaviour were exemplary and inſtructing. We bleſs the people in his Name, offer up their prayers to God in his Name, beſeech people in his ſtead to be reconciled to God. How neceſſary is it thoſe hands ſhould be cleanſed from all pollution, that are lift up to a holy God, in the Name of the Holy Jeſus, in the behalf of a people that he purified to himſelf to be a peculiar people zealous of good works? How incongruous and misbecoming is it, that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of the Son of God, who came into the World to deſtroy the works of the Devil, ſhould be addicted to any of thoſe which their Lord and Maſter came to deſtroy, that they who are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents for the Prince of peace, ſhould be of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome and contentious ſpirits; that they, whom he hath ſet apart to draw others to a conformity to his Laws and great example, ſhould violate and trample upon his Laws, and repreſent his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſo ill as if he were a Patron and Advocate of Impiety?</p>
            <p>I might add laſtly (as deſerving our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) that we cannot be wicked without being more inexcuſable than other ſinners, whether we know more or leſs than they. If we know more, and do as ill our ſtripes will be multiplied pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to the greatneſs of our Knowledge. If we know as little, and live as wickedly, the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102444:16"/>greater obligations and opportunities of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better, will be put upon our accounts. The Devils who fell from Heaven, fell deepeſt into Hell; and they who fall from Heaven Gates, from the greateſt advantages of knowing and living well, will be next to them in Torments.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible what miſconſtruction may be put upon my honeſt meaning, and that this preſſing the Miniſtry to the regard of purity, may by ſome be interpreted Reproach and Libelling. But to this I ſhall only ſay, that they who have the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand witneſſes to atteſt the truth of their ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may with joy and exultation of ſpirit, turn admonition to Panegyrick. And I hope there is a great number of ſuch here, who the leſs they have to reform, the more they have for which to rejoyce and to bleſs God. And for thoſe whoſe hearts ſmite them, may they continue ſo to do till repentance and amendment follow. We muſt pleaſe all men for their edification, and for their edification we muſt diſpleaſe them too. 'Twas a good wiſh that of <hi>Bernard's, Sic mihi contingat ſemper beare amicos, terrendo ſalubriter, non adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando fallaciter.</hi> Let us not think that our faults can eſcape Notice, the publickneſs of our ſtation, the nature of our employment will not ſuffer it. We are a Spectacle to Angels and men; the eyes of Friends and Enemies are upon us; theſe watch for our halting, thoſe eye us as their patterns.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102444:17"/>Let us not become a ſcorn to the one, nor a grief to the other, nor lay a ſtumbling block in the way of either. Let us be content to hear out Duties preſt upon us by our Friends, who do it in love and compaſſion to our ſouls; or rather let not that content us, but let us proceed to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate and abandon all our Vices. This is the moſt effectual courſe we can take to make all men good, and to make the hearts of all good men bleſs God for us, to gain our enemies, and force them to become our friends.

            </p>
            <p>I proceed now to the latter part of my Text, the Reaſon enforcing the Charge here given; <hi>That they may ſee your Good Works, and Glorifie your Father which is in Heaven. That they may ſee your Good Works.</hi> We muſt take heed we ſtop not there, for if our Aims be ſhort of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, our Reward will be on this ſide Heaven too. The moſt ſpecious and glorious works if done on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſeen of men, will find a Hell for their Reward in ſtead of an Heaven. But though a Good Naice may not be our laſt end, yet as tis ſubſervient to the Glory of God, as it renders us more uſeful to the World, and puts us into a greater Capacity of doing good, it is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102444:17"/>one of God's Choiceſt Bleſſings, to be received with thanks, preſerved with care, and procured by all warrantable means. Of all men a Miniſter ought to be moſt tender of it, ſince the Credit of his Perſon credits the Cauſe he manages, and 'tis natural for Contempt to paſs from the former to the latter. If men enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a low and mean opinion of the Speaker, they'l diſeſteem the things he ſpeaks, ſlight his Doctrine, reject his Counſels, ſcorn his Reproofs, never counſult him in Doubtful Caſes, and (to the Hazard of their Souls) neglect that neceſſary aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that otherwiſe they might receive from him: And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> thought it no misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming thing to wipe off thoſe Aſperſions caſt on him by the Factious Teachers in the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Indeed, 'tis ſometimes ſo far from being a fault that it becomes a piece of Neceſſary Juſtice that we owe to our ſelves, to vindicate our Names from Slander and Reproach. 'Tis one way of reſiſting the Devil, whoſe very name carries Slander in it, and one of whoſe greateſt Stratagems, to obſtruct the progreſs of Religion, is to blaſt the Reputation of its Miniſters, and bring both their Perſons and Office into diſgrace. And I could wiſh they would take notice of this, who any wayes contribute to bring a diſrepute upon the Clergy, that they only promote the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Hell, lend their aſſiſtance to the Devil,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102444:18"/>and help to uphold by this means his otherwiſe tottering Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But after all, a Good Name is beſt ſecured by the ſame Method our Eternal Salvation is. That patient continuance in well-doing whereby we ſeek for Glory, Honour, Immortality hereafter, will ſecure us ſuch a meaſure of eſteem here, as God ſees needful for us. Let us be but careful to diſcharge our Duty, and for our other concerns depoſit them in the ſame hands in which we truſt our Souls. And if when we do well we are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſpoken of, we may wear the Reproches of men as our Crown.</p>
            <p>Let us not therefore ſeparate what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath here united, but ſeek our Credit and Reputation ſo far only, as it is ſubſervient to the further Ends of God's Glory, and our Brethrens Edification, <hi>That men may ſee our Good Works and glorifie, &amp;c.</hi> What it is for men to glorifie God our Saviour himſelf can beſt interpret, and he tells us, <hi>John</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 8. that it is <hi>to bear much fruit;</hi> To have their Souls ſhining with Divine Graces, and their lives beautified with the Works of Holineſs, that is, to be renewed after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, which Renovation is wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by a hearty belief of the Goſpel, and ſincere endeavours to conform to the precepts of it. This then is the Purport of our Saviour's Words in the latter part of the Text; By being
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102444:18"/>thus burning and ſhining Light, we may be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Inſtruments to make others hearty and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtians. For by this means they will be brought firſt, to love and liking of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. They will conceive there is in it ſomething more than Humane, when it makes men ſo holy, humble and charitable, ſo uſeful to the World, ſo wholly taken up in promoting the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of mankind. 'Twill breed in them an high eſteem of the Goſpel. For as nothing is more injurious to it than an unſutable converſation in thoſe who are the Promulgers of it, ſo nothing more courts the eſteem of men to it, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it to their approbation, than a ſtrict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to its Rules. And when men once come to conceive High and Honourable thoughts of it, the next ſtep will be to ſubmit themſelves to the Laws of it, to put themſelves under its Diſcipline, and try what efficacy it may have upon their own Souls, which they ſee hath wrought ſuch admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects in the Souls of others. We may by this happy Union of Purity both in Life and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, be Inſtruments of begetting ſuch a quick and lively ſenſe of Religion in the hearts of men, ſuch a ſerious and ſober practice of it in their lives, ſuch a Zeal in them to tranſmit it down to their Poſterity, that the places we live in may be the better for us to the World's end, and all after-Ages may reap the fruits of our endeavours.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102444:19"/>The whole Chriſtian World hold their Religion at this day from thoſe that were the firſt Planters of it; every Age ſince hath been irradiated with their light, and ſwayed by their Great Examples. The Children of Light in all after Ages acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them for their ſpiritual Fathers, and the Generations yet to come will riſe up and call them bleſſed. They had extraordinary Abilities (you'l ſay) and brought Credentials from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Gift of Miracles, to atteſt the Truth of their Doctrine. 'Tis true, they had ſo, and ſo 'twas neceſſary they ſhould, being to propagate a new Doctrine, a Doctrine ſo contrary to all the Religions then received in the World, they being ſo few, and having ſuch a wide Province as the World aſſigned them, and that ſo entirely capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by Satan. But God, who proportions the meaſure of his Gifts to the neceſſities of the Age in which they are to be employed, is not wanting to beſtow upon us, even in this Age, what's need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the maintenance of true Religion, and ſuccesful oppoſition to the Kingdom of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Inſpired Gifts and Miracles were then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to convert a Heathen World. Abilities acquired by God's bleſſing on our own Induſtry, employed with honeſt hearts, ſeconded by good example, influenced by the Spirit of God, are as ſufficient for this Age, as Miracles were, for that. <hi>Manna</hi> wane ceſſary in the Wilderneſs where all
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102444:19"/>ordinary and natural ſupplies were wanting; but when <hi>Iſrael</hi> arrived in <hi>Canaan,</hi> where the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of life were ſupplied in a natural way from the Plenty and Fertility of the Soil, their miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous food ceaſed, nor do we find that ſtubborn, mutinous People ever repining at the loſs of it, their neceſſities being amply provided for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. I perſwade my ſelf, were Miracles neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Age we live in, we ſhould not want them. The Spirit of God, ſent on purpoſe to enable for the Work of the Miniſtry, doth ſtill afford all neceſſary Aids. Inſpired Gifts indeed are ceaſed, and Miracles, but the gracious effects of it upon the Hearts of men, attending our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry are ſtill continued. Where ever I ſee a Soul that's humble, and pure, and charitable, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in God, deſpiſing the World, patient in Sufferings, and forgiving injuries and enemies, there I am ſure the Spirit of God hath Breathed, Nay there he dwells. And (thanks be to God) the World is not ſo degenerate, but that many of this temper may be found that owe this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of their minds to the influence of the Divine Grace upon them in the uſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Miniſtry. So that what was adapted to the Circumſtances of the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, that is ceaſed; but what things accompany Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what tend to renewing the Image of God in the minds of men, <hi>fitting them to be partakes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102444:20"/>of the Inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> theſe are ſtill continued, and ſhall be to the World's end.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore (my Brethren) acquit our ſelves like faithful Stewards in the Diſcharge of our mighty Truſt. Thoſe Souls that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with the blood of God, are committed to our care. Let not what was ſo dear to him, be vile and cheap with us. Let us think no pains too great, no labour and circumſpection too much to be uſed in ſuch a weighty affair. <hi>Curſed,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>is he that doth the Work of the Lord negligently.</hi> And the more important the Work is, the heavier will be the Curſe, upon either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal neglect, or lazy performance. We have two Powerful Engines to reform a depraved World, the Purity of our Doctrine, and the Piety of our Lives, and they never work kindly and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in Conjunction. Never Conjunction of happy Stars ever portended ſuch Bleſſings to the World, as theſe <hi>Gemella Sydera,</hi> theſe Twin-Lights, when they twiſt their beams, and ſhed their united Influence upon it.</p>
            <p>Theſe would make us ſuch a Light of the World as would chaſe all works of darkneſs out of it, the Rulers of the darkneſs of this World would not be able to ſtand before us, if we put on this Armour of Light. A knowing and well inſtructed Piety is both Armour and Ornament; Armour both of defence and offence, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102444:20"/>of our warfare that will render us ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in fighting the Lord's Battels, ſignally inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in reducing a ſtubborn rebellious World to obedience to the Laws of our Bleſſed Saviour, the Captain of our Salvation. Let but this Command in the Text be obeyed, and we are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of his Aids whoſe Banners we fight under. <hi>For if our Light ſo ſhine before men, they will ſee our Good Works and Glorifie our Father which is in Heaven.</hi> We ſhall hereby ſecure our own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, credit the Goſpel, rejoyce the Angels in converting Sinners, make all good men with thankful hearts and tongues bleſs God for us, and our ſelves, after we have for a while been burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhining Lights in the World, ſhine as Stars for ever and ever in the Upper Regions of Light and Bliſs.</p>
